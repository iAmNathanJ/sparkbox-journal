This week we had our first formal reviews. I had the chance to sit down with my direct bosses and the owners of the company, and give a small presentation. The presentation was just a rehashing of the apprenticeship thus far. Pretty straightforward, but I was really nervous about it. Presenting is one of the largest challenges I'm facing. As far as I can tell, everybody here at Sparkbox is good at presenting. I don't know if it's a prereq to working here, or if it's just something that everyone happens to do well. It's definitely an important part of the tech industry, and it's a fear that I'd like to overcome. I'm not exactly sure how I'm going to do that. It may involve reaching out to some people who have struggled with the same thing. Maybe a public speaking class. I don't know, but I'm working on it.

The technical side of this week included more work on our Game of Life programs. I've been working on identifying seams and structuring code for future expansion and modularity. My ability to do this is not coming along as quickly as I'd like. But at least I'm having fun and learning. We also (finally!) started to talk about JavaScript this week. We haven't been using it for anything much, but the subject has been breached. This makes me happy.

I've been patiently awaiting the arrival of my daughter. She'll be delivered via induction unless she comes on her own by this coming Tuesday. Very excited!
