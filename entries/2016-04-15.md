**April 15, 2016**

This week I started playing ping pong regularly&mdash;once or twice a day. I'm preparing to be able to hold my own in a game of volley pong with the more experienced Sparboxers. I have a fair amount of work to do before that happens.

We're still focusing on front-end stuff. There were no apprentice meetings this week. There's been a lot going on in the office and some of the folks were out of town at [ConvergeSE](http://convergese.com/).

Some things I did this week:
  - spent more time working on my 3D game of life
  - wrote a pub-sub module and set up some basic data binding in a browser (just for fun)
  - learned about hand writing SVGs with Kasey and co-apprentices
  - worked on some CSS for an open source project by Patrick
  - started to learn about end-to-end testing with headless browsers thanks to Daniel

The week felt slow, but I actually got a fair amount accomplished. We apprentices, collectively, also talked about a group article that we're working on for [The Shift](https://twitter.com/startYourShift). Hopefully we'll get that done in time, without too much stress. This is our first test of collaboration.

Everything is still great. I love being at Sparkbox. :smile:
