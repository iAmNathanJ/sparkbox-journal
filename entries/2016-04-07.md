Haven't made a journal entry in a couple weeks. Things have been going well. My time away from work is mostly focused on my daughter, which is great, but it means that I haven't spent as much time learning outside of Sparkbox. I knew ahead of time that having a baby in the middle of the apprenticeship would be a challenge. As it turns out, it's actually not been so difficult. It's a welcome shift in my priorities and I think a mental break is good from time to time.

We've been in [phase two](https://github.com/sparkbox/apprenticeships/blob/master/index.md#phase-2---frontend-development-markup-style-interaction-and-preprocessing) of the apprenticeship for a few weeks now. We've been spending the majority of our time with HTML and CSS, and getting a ton of guidance from some of the really experienced devs here. Our first task in this phase was to create a series of simple [event cards](http://codepen.io/iAmNathanJ/pen/grmKae) using HTML and CSS. The card was to have an image, some text, and links to a map, etc. It was a chance to use what design skill I have, which is not much, but it was fun. I enjoy making visual things. We've been meeting bi-weekly to discuss methodology and go over stuff we're working on. The meetings are very informative.

Still having a great time here.
