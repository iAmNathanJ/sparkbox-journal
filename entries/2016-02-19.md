**February 19, 2016**

This week was good.  
Again.  
I'm still waking up excited, Monday through Friday. Starting to wonder if I'll get tired of this.

### Highlights for the week:  

**Gem City JS**  
I really love this [meetup](http://gemcityjs.com/) hosted in the office at Sparkbox, specifically because the focus is typically on JavaScript. This week they had [Marcy Sutton](https://twitter.com/marcysutton) piped in on a live video feed from Seattle to talk about accessibility. The fact that Sparkbox has connections like this is pretty fantastic.

**Mocking User Input in Tests**  
I spent a large portion of my week contemplating how to test apps that require user input. The only way I've found is to fake it, which requires wiring up a [mock module]((https://github.com/iAmNathanJ/bowling-kata/blob/master/solution5/test/mock.rb) to talk to app and use that in your tests. I assume there are tools available to facilitate this kind of testing, but I attempted to tackle the problem on my own, rather than hit Google. It's been fun.

**Design Patterns**  
We had a chance to go over some design patterns this week. I'm excited to dig into this subject over the coming weeks. I've spent some time on my own learning about some common patterns in the past, but haven't learned nearly enough. I'm hoping to find some pattern-specific katas to practice implementation. I'll be keeping a repo of examples with tests.

:heart:
