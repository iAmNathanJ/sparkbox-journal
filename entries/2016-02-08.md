Don't mind me as I jot down a self-affirming note.

Today was a pretty blah sort of day. The first time I've left Sparkbox not feeling at least somewhat good about what I've accomplished. As I make my way through the material we've been assigned, I expect some things to get easier. Today didn't really feel like progress.

One of the biggest challenges I'm facing is understanding how to write clean code. How to structure applications in one of the many right ways, instead of one of the many wrong ways. When my code feels forced, I know it's not a good thing. If I find myself writing an ugly series of conditional checks or nested loops, I know I should stop and rethink. But sometimes the simple solution I'm looking for just doesn't reveal itself. So I trudge forward to the land of painful abstractions and code dissatisfaction.

I tend to set unfair expectations for myself that are simply unrealistic. I expect to pick things up quickly and excel. I don't typically do this for other people, only myself. I'm making this journal entry as a reminder to myself that when I think I'm not cut out for this, I should look at where I started and where I am now. I should recognize that I'm capable and that not all days are going to feel like huge strides.

I'm thankful for the opportunity to do this.
