**February 12, 2016**

This week started off a little [less than perfect](https://github.com/iAmNathanJ/sparkbox-journal/blob/master/entries/2016-02-08.md). I thought that, before coming to Sparkbox, I had learned to embrace the learning process, but this week has challenged that assertion. I've become comfortable looking at things that are confusing because I know that with persistence those things becomes clear. And that's a good feeling. In this new setting, however, I have placed expectations on myself without really being aware of it. And the learning process has been more difficult as a result. Recognizing that my expectations should be reasonable gives me another target to aim for. More of a personal target, but an important one.

Codewise, this week has centered around [bowling](https://github.com/iAmNathanJ/bowling-kata) with Ruby. I've done [kata](https://github.com/iAmNathanJ/bowling-kata/blob/master/solution2/bowling_game.rb), after [kata](https://github.com/iAmNathanJ/bowling-kata/blob/master/solution3/bowling_game.rb), after [kata](https://github.com/iAmNathanJ/bowling-kata/blob/master/solution5/bowling_game.rb). I'm ready to move on. Aside from that, I was also able to spend more time learning Git, write down some [thoughts about a book](https://github.com/iAmNathanJ/sparkbox-journal/blob/master/book-reviews/getting-real.md), continue practicing TDD, and generally drink in more knowledge of my cohorts and mentors.

So, that's one more good week. Excited as ever to continue this process.
