Ruby! Up to this point, I have't taken the time to learn Ruby. This week we were asked to spend time getting to know Ruby or expanding our knowledge thereof. I'm starting to like it and I think I'm picking it up ok. Aside from syntax-shock, some of the language paradigms are new to me and that's where I'm having the most difficulty. I'm starting to like it. I'm *really* eager to tackle this one.

The majority of our time has been self-directed learning, which is pretty cool. I struggled at first to feel comfortable in such a relaxed setting. Doesn't make sense, but it's true.

We also spent time with Git this week. After meeting with a couple experienced devs to talk about Git and how Sparkbox uses it, I've realized how much better distributed version control is for developers. I learned a whole bunch of stuff and I'm not afraid to touch Sparkbox repo anymore. Win.

The best part of this week has been getting to know the individuals at Sparkbox more.
