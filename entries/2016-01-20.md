This is what stands out about my first week as a Sparkbox apprentice.

I was late on day one. Whoops. In all fairness, I live 85 miles away and we were hit with a snow storm. I don't think they were too upset with me.

I met my co-apprentices in person for the first time. They are all awesome. More on them later.

The first thing we were taught (after a tour of the amazing office space at Sparkbox) was how to play ["Ping Volley Pong Ball"](https://the-pastry-box-project.net/ben-callahan/2015-april-26)
- Brain overload
- Questioned my ability to do this
- Great conversation with co-apprentices to close week
