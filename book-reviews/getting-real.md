# Getting Real

Getting real covered high level concepts with regards to developing and shipping products. I enjoyed the message. This book evangelizes minimalism in all facets of the product life-cycle, and that's something I can appreciate. The author suggests that keeping things small&mdash;teams, product features&mdash;is paramount to a successful product.

Among the topics covered, peripheral to the core message of the book were things such as:
- open source software: contributing, utilizing, and sharing of knowledge
- customer service: understanding that users are at the top of the priority list
- product testing: testing products in real world situations
- employees: without the people who build your product, you have nothing

Although the content appealed to me, I didn't love the writing style. The author, Jason Fried, is very opinionated, and that's ok. But it sometimes felt like he was yelling his point across, rather than making a thoughtful, composed argument. I tend to believe the cleaner path is always the better choice. However, it's not always a possible choice. When creating a product or service from the ground up, you (hopefully) have the ability to create your own circumstances. So, take advantage of that freedom.

The biggest take-aways I have from the book are to pursue the simplicity. Avoiding project bloat requires an ongoing presence of mind. Sharing what you learn as you develop will contribute to your personal and business growth, and you should utilize what other people share as well. Also, you should use the products you create. This will reveal where features are lacking and where the bugs are hiding.
